# My Take on HFR
*(originally published on 07/01/2013)*

I went to see the Hobbit again yesterday.

The first time I saw it was in 24fps with active 3d glasses. Yesterday, however, we saw it in IMAX passive 3d, at the High Frame Rate of 48FPS.
It was like night and day.


it was fascinating to see clearly the tremors in every actorsâ€™ hands, and the crisp motion detail that is normally blurred unconsciously by our minds stand out in sharp relief.
Opinion has been divided on HFR, but I did not find it a detraction. I found that once my brain had stopped filling in the gaps between frames that were no longer there, 10 minutes in, it was a wonderful experience.
I liken it to one who, after listening to heavily-mastered orchestral music all their life, with every breath and unwanted noise removed and balanced in mastering, suddenly finding themselves in the front seat at the Apollo, hearing every detail.

You must try it for yourself!
